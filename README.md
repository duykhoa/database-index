# Why

To improve the performance of application in database level, usually we heard about database index.
However, adding database index requires basic knowledge to make it right, otherwise, it could make

With a list of examples, we will see how index improves the system performance and go deeper to
analyze how database use the index. The result of this are some practical tips that we can apply to
the work/side projects.

A side notes. Database index is an important technique that every developer should know. However, it
isn't the only way to optimize the system's performance. To optimize the application, it starts with
the design of application (code level), database design, database index, caching, search engine,
infrastructure, and ofcourse depend on the business requirements as well. There is no such general
solution can be applied for all situation.
